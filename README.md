Welcome to my eCommerce Data Science assignment repository.
This repository contains the work done for a comprehensive data analysis project based on a provided eCommerce transactions dataset, which consists of customer, product, and transaction details. The project is divided into three main tasks, each focused on extracting valuable insights and building machine learning models.

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
In this section, I performed an in-depth analysis of the provided dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies. Various visualizations and statistical techniques were used to understand customer behavior, product sales, and transaction patterns. I also derived five actionable business insights based on the EDA, which highlight potential areas of improvement for business strategies and customer targeting.

Task 2: Lookalike Model
For this task, I developed a lookalike model to identify customers similar to a given profile. The model uses customer and product information, including demographic and transaction data, to recommend the top three similar customers for any given user. The lookalike recommendations are based on a similarity score that is computed using advanced algorithms, such as cosine similarity, to measure the closeness between customer profiles.

Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
I performed customer segmentation using clustering techniques on both customer profile and transaction data. The goal was to group customers based on their behaviors, purchasing patterns, and demographic information. Several clustering algorithms were tested, and the optimal clustering solution was chosen based on the Davies-Bouldin index and other relevant metrics. I visualized the clusters and discussed the characteristics of each segment in the report.

The repository includes:

Jupyter Notebooks with detailed code for each task
A PDF report summarizing the findings and insights for each task
A CSV file for the lookalike model recommendations
This project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and deriving business insights from data. Feel free to explore the repository for the full analysis and model implementations.
