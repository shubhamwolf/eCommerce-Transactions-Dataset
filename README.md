eCommerce Transactions Dataset

Overview:
You are provided with an eCommerce Transactions dataset consisting of three files:
Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv. Your task is to perform
exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and derive actionable insights. This
assignment will test your data analysis, machine learning, and business insight generation skills.
Customers.csv:

Products.csv :

Transactions.csv :

Files Description:
1. Customers.csv
○ CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
○ CustomerName: Name of the customer.
○ Region: Continent where the customer resides.
○ SignupDate: Date when the customer signed up.
2. Products.csv
○ ProductID: Unique identifier for each product.
○ ProductName: Name of the product.
○ Category: Product category.
○ Price: Product price in USD.
3. Transactions.csv
○ TransactionID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
○ CustomerID: ID of the customer who made the transaction.
○ ProductID: ID of the product sold.
○ TransactionDate: Date of the transaction.

○ Quantity: Quantity of the product purchased.
○ TotalValue: Total value of the transaction.
○ Price: Price of the product sold.

Assignment Tasks:
Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
1. Perform EDA on the provided dataset.
2. Derive at least 5 business insights from the EDA.
○ Write these insights in short point-wise sentences (maximum 100 words per
insight).
Deliverables:
● A Jupyter Notebook/Python script containing your EDA code.
● A PDF report with business insights (maximum 500 words).

Task 2: Lookalike Model
Build a Lookalike Model that takes a user's information as input and recommends 3 similar
customers based on their profile and transaction history. The model should:
● Use both customer and product information.
● Assign a similarity score to each recommended customer.
Deliverables:
● Give the top 3 lookalikes with there similarity scores for the first 20 customers
(CustomerID: C0001 - C0020) in Customers.csv. Form an “Lookalike.csv” which has
just one map: Map<cust_id, List<cust_id, score>>
● A Jupyter Notebook/Python script explaining your model development.
Evaluation Criteria:
● Model accuracy and logic.
● Quality of recommendations and similarity scores.

Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Use both profile information
(from Customers.csv) and transaction information (from Transactions.csv).
● You have the flexibility to choose any clustering algorithm and any number of clusters in
between(2 and 10)
● Calculate clustering metrics, including the DB Index(Evaluation will be done on this).
● Visualise your clusters using relevant plots.
Deliverables:
● A report on your clustering results, including:
○ The number of clusters formed.
○ DB Index value.
○ Other relevant clustering metrics.
● A Jupyter Notebook/Python script containing your clustering code.
Evaluation Criteria:
● Clustering logic and metrics.
● Visual representation of clusters.

Submission Instructions:
1. GitHub Link
○ Upload all the PDF and code files in a public GitHub repository.
2. File Naming Convention:
○ Use the following naming convention for all your files:
■ FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf
■ FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb
■ FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv
■ FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb
■ FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf
■ FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb

Evaluation Process:
Your submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Task Weightage
Exploratory Data Analysis 25%
Business Insights 15%
Lookalike Model 30%
Customer Segmentation 30%
Given the large number of submissions, the evaluation will be automated as much as possible.
Ensure your file formats and naming conventions are accurate to avoid disqualification.
